# Dr. Fit 1004

Welcome to the repository for Dr. Fit 1004, a comprehensive fitness application designed to provide users with personalised fitness and nutrition plans. This project is part of the final portfolio for the COMP1004 module, focusing on creating a user-friendly and interactive single-page application (SPA).

## Final Portfolio Contents

This portfolio includes the following items to showcase the development and features of the Dr. Fit application:

- [X] A final project plan that illustrates the project's backlog and sprints.
- [X] A complete set of UML diagrams representing the application's architecture.
- [X] Completed and finished GitHub repository with comprehensive documentation.
- [X] A README file that outlines the project's purpose, usage, and key features. (Current document)
- [X] A poster illustrating the key features of the application and its architecture. (To-Do)
- [X] A reflective account considering the challenges and lessons learned throughout the project development process. (To-Do)

## Project Objectives

- [X] Transform into a SPA.
- [X] Implement an index HTML page that serves as the application's entry point.
- [X] Enable JSON output to a flat file for data persistence.
- [X] Enhance SPA interactivity to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Completed Tasks

- [X] Optimised `styles.css` for better visual appeal and performance.
- [X] Created a 'Calculate Plan' feature for instant fitness planning.
- [X] Displayed calorific needs upfront before fetching API responses.
- [X] Integrated determination level into calorific needs and prompts.
- [X] Addressed health concerns for user-specific calorie reduction.
- [X] Formatted API responses for clarity and readability.
- [X] Developed registration JavaScript for form handling and validation.
- [X] Established GPT-based function calling for dynamic interaction.
- [X] Resolved report generation issue.
- [X] Activated additional calculation functions.
- [X] Integrated the YouTube API and documented its implementation.
- [X] Provided comprehensive inline comments for YouTube API integration(I can't find this anyways, however I did copy the functionality onto my VidBriefs app i made)

## To-Do List

- [ ] Record function calls in conversation history for better tracking.
- [ ] Refine MET value calculation for running activities with speed = distance/time conversions.
- [ ] Develop additional BMI calculations for a broader assessment.
- [ ] Complete the 'Calories Burnt' calculation function.
- [ ] Explore GPT-3's potential in generating tailored nutrition plans in `nutrition.py`.
- [ ] Investigate GPT-3's ability in formulating workout plans in `workout.py`.
- [ ] Finalise registration checks to ensure data integrity.
- [ ] Optimise function speed by reducing database connections within functions.
- [ ] Determine the most effective calorie calculation method for each fitness goal.
- [ ] Implement YouTube transcripts for an enriched multimedia experience.
- [ ] Delegate all calculations to OpenAI API with function calls.
- [ ] Devise a method to assess user health and fitness levels (e.g., integration with Apple Health).
- [ ] Test image generation capabilities for functional visual content.
- [ ] Implement best practices in AI prompting as recommended by OpenAI.
- [ ] Provide functions to GPT for autonomous function calls and report generation.

## Advanced Functionality

Future iterations of Dr. Fit 1004 aim to include advanced functions such as:

- Waist to Height Ratio
- Waist to Hip Ratio
- Lean Body Mass and Fat Mass calculations
- VO2 Max estimations
- One Rep Max (1RM) predictions
- Detailed pace and split times for various sports
- Protein and hydration requirements for individual users

## Example Function Call Prompt

Users can interact with Dr. Fit using natural language, and it'll make calls to functions if necessary. For example:

- "How many calories will I burn if I do 30 minutes of {activity}?"
